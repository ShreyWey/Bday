                    Happy birthday to the cutest, most gorgeous, charming, charismatic, beautiful, kind, caring, loving, reliable, supportive, compassionate, affectionate, funny, and lovable woman in this universe. I'm glad I joined the TAMU Discord server where I met you. We started off by texting and then calling each other. I remember I would hop on a call at like 1 am, and before I knew it, it would be 3. Time with you would just fly by. And then when I first saw you during a call, I was stunned by your beauty. When we met at the MSC for the first time in person, I was amazed by your beauty and energy. I didn't open doors and carry your bag because it was a Texan thing; I did it because I started to like you. Hanging out with you during Howdy Week was amazing, especially when I would get to drop you off at your dorm alone. I love the one-on-one time we spend. I remember the night when you flirted with me and told me that you liked me, and I came to your dorm that night to ask you out. That was one of the best decisions I ever made. I remember when I dropped you off to your dorm, and you let me hold you your hand and waist on the way up the stairs. All the dates we went on, I loved every single one of them. I could go on for hours talking about all our memories together, but I just want to say I love you, and thank you for being in my life. <br> Shrey
